# System Architecture

## Overview

The Multi-Agent Software Development Pipeline is designed as a distributed microservices architecture that implements a sophisticated AI-powered development workflow. The system processes project requirements through six distinct stages, each handled by specialized agents that communicate asynchronously via message queues.

## Architectural Principles

### Microservices Architecture
- **Service Independence**: Each agent runs as an independent service with dedicated resources
- **Loose Coupling**: Agents communicate only through standardized message interfaces
- **Single Responsibility**: Each agent handles one specific stage of the development pipeline
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Individual agents can be scaled independently based on demand

### Event-Driven Communication
- **Asynchronous Processing**: All inter-agent communication is asynchronous via message queues
- **Message Durability**: Messages are persisted to ensure reliable delivery
- **Event Sourcing**: Pipeline state changes are captured as events for audit and replay
- **Pub/Sub Pattern**: Agents publish and subscribe to relevant message topics

### Observability
- **Distributed Tracing**: Complete request tracing across all services
- **Metrics Collection**: Comprehensive metrics for performance monitoring
- **Centralized Logging**: Structured logging aggregated across all services
- **Health Monitoring**: Automated health checks and alerting
