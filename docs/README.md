## B. Requirements-to-Files Mapping
A summary of the current mapping between Iteration-4 requirements and their implementations:

| Status       | Count |
| ------------ | ----- |
| Implemented  | 7     |
| Stubbed      | 3     |
| Total        | 10    |

Sample entries from docs/iteration4_mapping.md:

| Requirement ID / Description              | Implementing File(s)                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| REQ-001: User authentication              | src/auth/auth-controller.js, src/auth/auth-service.js         |
| REQ-002: Data validation                  | src/utils/data-validator.js                                   |
| REQ-123: Payment processing               | UNMAPPED                                                      |
| REQ-456: Edge-case X handling             | UNMAPPED                                                      |
| REQ-789: Reporting generation             | UNMAPPED                                                      |

## C. Next Steps
- Complete stub implementations for UNMAPPED requirements:  
  • REQ-123: stub at src/payment-processing-stub.js, test at tests/payment-processing-stub.test.js  
  • REQ-456: stub at src/edge-case-x-handler-stub.js, test at tests/edge-case-x-handler-stub.test.js  
  • REQ-789: stub at src/reporting-generation-stub.js, test at tests/reporting-generation-stub.test.js  
- Flesh out business logic in newly created modules until all requirements are fully satisfied.  
- Enhance CI pipeline/quality gates:  
  • Enforce kebab-case filenames via pre-commit hook or lint rule  
  • Verify that each requirement is either implemented or has a stub before merging  
  • Regenerate and diff directory snapshot against docs/project_structure.txt  
- Plan for Iteration-6: integration testing, performance tuning, security audit, and complete feature coverage.
